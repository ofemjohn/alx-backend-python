# Asynchronous Programming with `async` and `await` in Python

Asynchronous programming is a technique that allows programs to perform tasks concurrently, which can improve the performance and responsiveness of your applications. In Python, asynchronous programming can be achieved using async and await keywords, which were introduced in Python 3.5 as part of the asyncio module.

## Getting Started with `async` and `await`
To start using async and await, you need to understand the following concepts:

Coroutines: A coroutine is a special kind of function that can be paused and resumed during its execution. Coroutines are defined with the async def syntax, and they use the await keyword to suspend their execution until a certain condition is met.

Event Loop: An event loop is a central component of asyncio that manages the scheduling and execution of coroutines. The event loop is responsible for handling I/O operations, timers, and other asynchronous events.

Tasks: A task is a higher-level abstraction that represents the execution of a coroutine. A task is created by submitting a coroutine to the event loop with the asyncio.create_task() function.
