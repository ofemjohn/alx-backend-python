Python - Async Comprehension

# Asynchronous Comprehension in Python
Python's asynchronous comprehension feature was introduced in version 3.6. Asynchronous comprehension is an extension to the existing list and dictionary comprehensions, which allows us to create asynchronous generators.

Async comprehension provides a convenient way to write asynchronous code that fetches data from multiple sources in parallel. This can help improve the overall performance of the application.
